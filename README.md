# LIBS_Elemental_Analysis

Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy(LIBS) is a versetile tool to quatintatively and qualitatively analyse a sample using laser abalation.
This Software Gives one the ability to computationally perform the Analysis for a LIBS Spectra.

This commit marks the rebuild of the repository. there are major changes in the implementation which would hopefully make this into a module which can be used in other programs.

This is a complete revamp of the existing repository. After its last update, i worked almost completely locally as the code was working and needed mostly minor improvements, or needed to be used for some specifc use cases, this caused the repo to become messed up and lose track of what was happening. I also started Experimenting on different forms of UIs and other things, and then the code got messed up and needed tons of refactoring before being pushed into git.

Today I decided to fix it. So I am going to keep the local repo as separate and fixing the main repo one commit at a time.

As this is a complete revamp, the initial few commits wont make much sense. The working of the code in itself is not going to change, just the arrangement of the file structure, refactoring of files and other things as they become necessary.

The licence feature of this repository and making it public will happen only once it has a stable release and is approved by my supervisor for whome I started building this Repository.

I am also Restructuring the Readme.md file so that it becomes easier to add notes to the repo if necessary.

This is supposed to be a better version of the elemental analysis model i made. The original one was never added to github.

I wont be using my peak analysis software but insted be using the signal processing in scipy to find the peaks.
